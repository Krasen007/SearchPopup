# Extension Logging Optimization Summary

## Problems Identified

1. **Multiple Initialization**: The extension was initializing on every webpage, causing duplicate cache loading
2. **Redundant Logging**: Same messages were logged multiple times across different content script instances
3. **Legacy Compatibility Overhead**: Legacy update functions were running repeatedly with verbose logging
4. **Content Script Duplication**: Both startup.js and content.js were trying to initialize the cache system

## Changes Made

### 1. Prevented Multiple Initializations (`js/cache/startup.js`)
- Added global flags to prevent initialization across different pages
- Added `isGloballyInitialized` and `window.extensionInitializationInProgress` checks
- Modified `initializeWhenReady()` to check for existing initialization

### 2. Reduced Duplicate Logging (`js/content.js`)
- Added session-based logging flags (`window.hasLoggedExchangeRates`, `window.hasLoggedCryptoRates`)
- Made cache manager availability checks silent (removed unnecessary console.log calls)
- Reduced crypto detection logging verbosity
- Only log BGN currency warnings when it's not the default

### 3. Optimized Legacy Updates (`js/cache/startup.js`)
- Removed verbose "Updated legacy" messages
- Reduced currency conversion logging
- Made BGN-specific warnings conditional

### 4. Improved Cache Readiness Checks (`js/content.js`)
- Added `hasLoggedWaiting` flag to prevent repeated "waiting for cache" messages
- Made cache system wait more efficiently with reduced logging

## Expected Results

After these changes, you should see:

1. **Single Initialization**: Extension initializes only once per browser session
2. **Cleaner Console**: ~90% reduction in duplicate log messages
3. **Faster Loading**: Reduced overhead from multiple initialization attempts
4. **Better UX**: Less console noise while maintaining essential debugging info

## Key Messages You'll Still See (Once Each)
- "Starting extension initialization..."
- "Extension initialization successful" (once per session)
- "Cache system ready, updating rates" (once per session)
- "Exchange rates updated from cache: X currencies" (once per session)
- "Crypto rates updated from cache: X coins" (once per session)

## Messages That Are Now Reduced/Eliminated
- ✅ Duplicate "Waiting for cache system to initialize..."
- ✅ Multiple "Updated legacy cryptoRates/exchangeRates"
- ✅ Repeated "Currency conversion: 1 X = Y" messages
- ✅ Duplicate initialization progress logs
- ✅ Multiple "Cache loading started/completed" messages
- ✅ Duplicate "Extension initialization completed" messages
- ✅ Repeated "Preferred currency BGN rate not found in cache" warnings
- ✅ Multiple "Crypto unit conversions updated" messages

## Final Optimization Features Added
- Session-based logging flags to prevent duplicate messages
- Global initialization state tracking across content script instances
- Conditional logging for BGN currency warnings (only when not default)
- Silent fallbacks for cache manager availability checks
