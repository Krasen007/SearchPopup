ðŸ”¥ **CRITICAL PRIORITY**
*   **Architecture & Setup**
    *   **[ITEM]** - **Refactor the monolithic `content.js` into modules.** The current `content.js` file is over 800 lines long and handles everything from DOM manipulation and UI logic to API calls and business logic for conversions. This makes it difficult to maintain, debug, and test.
        *   **Rationale:** Breaking it down into smaller, focused modules (e.g., `ui.js`, `api.js`, `conversions.js`, `main.js`) will improve code organization, reduce coupling, and make the codebase much easier to manage and scale.
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** 2-3 Days
        *   **Dependencies:** None

    *   **[ITEM]** - **Introduce a build process and module bundler.** The project currently lacks any build tools, preventing the use of modern development features like JavaScript modules, TypeScript, or automated linting.
        *   **Rationale:** Using a bundler like Webpack or Vite will enable a modern module system, allow for code splitting, and minify the code, which can improve performance. It's a foundational step for improving developer experience and code quality.
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** 1 Day
        *   **Dependencies:** None

*   **Security & Performance**
    *   **[ITEM]** - **Implement a robust testing framework.** The project has no automated tests, making it risky to refactor or add new features.
        *   **Rationale:** Introducing a testing framework like Jest or Vitest and writing unit tests for the conversion logic and utility functions will ensure that existing functionality doesn't break during development. It will also improve the overall quality and reliability of the extension.
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** 2-3 Days
        *   **Dependencies:** Build process setup

ðŸš€ **HIGH PRIORITY**
*   **Feature Improvements**
    *   **[ITEM]** - **Improve error handling and user feedback.** While there is some basic error handling for API calls, it could be more comprehensive. The UI should provide clearer feedback to the user when something goes wrong (e.g., API is down, conversion is not possible).
        *   **Impact:** Medium
        *   **Effort:** 1 Day
        *   **Dependencies:** None



ðŸ“ˆ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
*   **Enhancements**
    *   **[ITEM]** - **Add loading indicators.** When the extension is fetching data from APIs (for currency or crypto rates), there is no visual feedback to the user.
        *   **Rationale:** Adding a loading spinner or a subtle animation would improve the user experience by making it clear that the extension is working.
        *   **Impact:** Medium
        *   **Effort:** 4-6 Hours
        *   **Dependencies:** None

*   **Developer Experience**
    *   **[ITEM]** - **Set up a linter and code formatter.** Enforcing a consistent code style with tools like ESLint and Prettier will improve code quality and readability, especially if multiple developers work on the project.
        *   **Impact:** Medium
        *   **Effort:** 2-4 Hours
        *   **Dependencies:** Build process setup
