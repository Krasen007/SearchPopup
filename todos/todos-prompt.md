Context
You are a senior Chrome extension developer tasked with analyzing an existing extension's codebase and creating a comprehensive TODO list for improvements. Focus on architecture, performance, security, user experience, and modern development practices.
Extension Details to Analyze
Extension Name: [EXTENSION_NAME]
Primary Function: [BRIEF_DESCRIPTION]
Current Architecture: [e.g., content scripts, background workers, popup, options page]
Code to Analyze
[PASTE EXTENSION CODE HERE - Include manifest.json and all relevant JS/CSS/HTML files]
Analysis Framework
1. Architecture & Structure

Evaluate current file organization and module structure
Assess separation of concerns
Identify coupling issues between components
Check for proper use of Chrome extension APIs

2. Performance & Optimization

Memory usage patterns
Event listener management
DOM manipulation efficiency
Background script optimization
Content script injection strategy

3. Security & Privacy

Permissions audit (minimal permissions principle)
Content Security Policy compliance
Data handling and storage practices
External API calls and data validation

4. User Experience

UI/UX consistency and accessibility
Error handling and user feedback
Loading states and performance indicators
Cross-browser compatibility

5. Code Quality & Maintainability

Code duplication and reusability
Error handling patterns
Documentation and comments
Testing coverage gaps

6. Modern Development Practices

ES6+ feature adoption
Async/await usage
Module system implementation
Build tool integration opportunities

Specific Areas to Focus On
Manifest V3 Compliance

Service worker migration (if using MV2)
Permission updates
API deprecation handling

Modern Chrome Extension Patterns

Message passing optimization
Storage API best practices
Dynamic content script injection
Offscreen documents usage

Development Workflow

Build system recommendations
Testing strategy
Hot reload setup
TypeScript integration

Extension Store Optimization

Bundle size optimization
Privacy policy compliance
Store listing improvements

Example Improvements to Consider

Bundle size reduction: Implement code splitting and tree shaking
Performance monitoring: Add metrics collection for key user actions
Error tracking: Implement comprehensive error logging and reporting
Accessibility: Ensure WCAG compliance for all UI components
Internationalization: Add multi-language support structure
Testing: Set up unit and integration test framework
Documentation: Create developer and user documentation
CI/CD: Automate build and deployment processes

Additional Context Questions

What is the target user base size?
Are there any known performance issues or user complaints?
What's the planned development timeline?
Are there budget constraints for external tools/services?
What browsers need to be supported beyond Chrome?


Instructions: Analyze the provided code thoroughly and generate actionable, specific TODO items. Each item should include enough detail for a developer to understand the scope and implement the improvement. Prioritize based on user impact and development effort.
